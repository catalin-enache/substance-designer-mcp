# REVIEW.md: review findings

Findings from code reviews of this repository, kept across several reviews as a file in the project. How many is
the user's choice, most likely the life of a feature branch; the history stays in git for good.

This file is the **memory per branch**. Agents that review and agents that address findings talk through it, as
in a PR review: a finding is raised, then fixed or answered with why not, so the next reviewers know what was
settled and don't raise it again. Once the branch is merged it can be cleaned up. `DECISIONS.md` is the memory for
the whole project.

A new review **appends** its findings to the matching severity section and adds itself to the log; it never removes
or rewrites existing entries. An entry is checked when it is resolved, always with a resolution line that starts
with one of these wordings: done, not a bug, not reproducible, won't fix. Format and rules:
`.claude/skills/project-code-review/` (SKILL.md, TEMPLATE.md).

**Confidence.**

- *Confirmed*: the lead agent read the code and the defect is visible in it, as quoted.
- *Measured*: reading couldn't settle it, and the lead agent's scratch probe in Designer showed it (the entry gives
  the probe and what it measured; the `project-code-review` skill). A finding is one or the other, never a guess.

**IDs.** One prefix per area, numbered on: **PLG** plugin and bridge protocol, **SRV**
`mcp_server/server.py` and `server_tools/`, **HLP** `mcp_server/designer_helpers/`, **INS** installer, uninstaller,
command-line client and example, **TST** tests and docs. A new area gets a new prefix, added here.

**Last used:** PLG-42, SRV-110, HLP-106, INS-27, TST-307.

A new finding takes the next number for its area, and whoever writes it updates this line in the same edit. Only a
new finding raises it, and a cleanup leaves it as it is. Nothing lowers a committed number; dropping a finding before
committing it undoes its change.

**Findings no longer here.** Only the user starts a cleanup of this file (the `cleanup-review` skill). An ID
cited elsewhere but missing here was usually removed by one, which isn't a dangling reference.
`python3 scripts/review_lookup.py HLP-56` prints the whole entry, from this file or its git history, from any folder
of the repo. If it can't, it says why: the ID never existed, a squash lost it, or the clone is shallow.
